# Ticket-Booking-System-Using-Core-Java

A console-based ticket reservation system built using Core Java, demonstrating the use of Collections, OOP, and custom exception handling.

***Description***

The Train Ticket Booking System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate core ticket reservation operations in a railway system. This project demonstrates practical usage of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Java Collections Framework, and Exception Handling without the use of external libraries or databases.

The system enables users to book tickets, view all bookings, search tickets by ticket number or boarding point, update existing bookings, and cancel tickets. The entire dataset is managed in-memory using an ArrayList, with robust input validation and custom exception handling to ensure smooth execution and prevent runtime failures.

***Tech Stack :***

Language : Java

Concepts : OOP, Collections Framework, Exception Handling

Data Structure : ArrayList

Execution : Command-Line Interface (CLI)

***Future Enhancements :*** 

**Database Integration (JDBC) :** Replace the in-memory ArrayList with persistent storage using MySQL or SQLite. This would allow ticket data to remain even after program restarts.

**GUI Implementation :** Create a user-friendly interface using JavaFX or Swing, making it easier for non-technical users to interact with the system.
